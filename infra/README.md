## Outline

The goal of this assignment to getting familiar with AWS and AWS related products.
For this, a web application has to be deployed on AWS and served via AWS CloudFront or AWS S3.
The user interface of the web application is provided. The students have to provision the deployment environment and implement a API using AWS Lambda and store eventual data in the AWS DynamoDB.
The API definitions can be found in the README of the UI folder.

Following tools will be used in this assignment:

- AWS CloudFront
- AWS S3
- AWS Lambda
- AWS DynamoDB
- AWS Dashboard
- Pulumi

Hint and pitfalls:

- Pulumi is language agnostic. Use the coding language you are most confortable with!
